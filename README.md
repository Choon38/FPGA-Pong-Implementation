# FPGA Pong Game Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the classic Pong game on an FPGA using Verilog. The project is divided into three parts, each enhancing the previous version with new features and optimizations.

## Project Structure

- **Pong_pt1**: Basic implementation of the Pong game, including paddle control and ball movement.
- **Pong_pt2**: Enhanced version with improved game logic and user interface features.
- **Pong_pt3**: Final version with advanced graphics and additional gameplay features.

## Technologies Used
- Verilog HDL
- FPGA Development Board
- VGA Signal Processing

## Features
- Real-time game play
- VGA display output
- Modular design for easy understanding and enhancements
